Raddons Version 0.01-1: to initialize the package. Add three functions: (1) edf; (2) lm.ci (3) model.test.

==> Version 0.01-2: residual.plot, influential.plot and predictor.plot

==> Change package name to stats (10/26/2011)

==> Version 1.0-2: update loading information using "bstats 1.0..."
   add the model selection/variable selection criteria for the fitted
   model.  And update the VIF output.  Add condition to model.check to
